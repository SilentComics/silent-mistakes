- **Circling the details**
- **Pick up the details** (that stand out to you)

3. **Write** for a solid hour uninterrupted — Just keep writing no matter what — get rolling
4. Take time to "Digest" then **REVISE** using Kuskin Rule #3, end every paragraph with a strong statement
5. Ask "What is the POINT"  — **What is the conclusion?** A chance to make a strong statement — "So what?" and revise again
6. **Read it out LOUD** and correct for final submission

# Essay tips from Prof. Kuskin:

### Find out what the teacher wants:
* Get the assignment prompt and **break it into its individual parts** - this becomes **the skeleton for your essay**.

### Don’t start with the introduction paragraph

- seriously, this is a great way of stumping yourself ten minutes into the writing process
- you’re trying to write an intro for a paper that doesn’t exist yet?
- start with the first body paragraph

### Your awesome body paragraphs

- the cool thing about the essay is that you pretty much get to tell people what to think
- don’t hold back
- your name is already on the top of the page, so whatever you say, try to really mean it

### Conclusion paragraph

- the conclusion is like the end of a 30 seconds commercial where they hold the product up at the end just in case you forgot you were watching a commercial
- hold up your argument for the audience one more time
- just in case they forgot what they just read

### Introduction paragraph

- now that you have body paragraphs and a conclusion, rewrite your conclusion to introduce your topic
- notice how easier it is to introduce something AFTER you’ve written about it
- slap a badass thesis statement at the end of your intro

### Thesis statement

- remember the skeleton from the beginning — take it back out
- make a single sentence that talks about all those points
- it’s fine to write a sentence that says: “in this essay, I argue that…”
- then just list those things — done.

### Quotes

- quotes are a great way to make yourself look credible and to add length to your paper
- you need to talk before and after a quote
- tell people who you are quoting
- tell people why they should care

### Citations!

Well, citations can be nice, it shows that you researched something about your subject but they can be a double edged sword if you don’t actually reference them in the proper context. Incomplete, out of context or false quotes are bad.
